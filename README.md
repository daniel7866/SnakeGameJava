# SnakeGameJava
This is a snake game made in Java Swing

To make things a bit more intersting, each time the snake eats the apple the background changes, and when the snake eats itself it will shrink.

It also has highscore - when a user beats the highscore it will ask for his name and save it in a file, and in the menu when a user will click on the Highscore button it will show the highest sore with it's name.
